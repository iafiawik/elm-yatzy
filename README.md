# elm-yatzy

A small Elm application I developed to explore the world of Elm.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app) but has since then been ejected (mostly to add SASS support).

## Start the application

Run `npm run start` in a terminal.

## Build the application

Run `npm run build` in a terminal.

## Stack

* Elm (`0.19`)
* SASS
* [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)
